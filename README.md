# Note-Taker

## Project Description
This project tested my ability to build the server-side backend code to an existing frontend code base. The project itself is designed to allow the user to take notes, store them, and display them. Delete functionality is optional and is visible on the frontend.

## User Story
The user is a small business owner who wants to write and save notes. This application allows the small business owner to organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks needed to be completed. In reality, the application is simple yet versatile, so the user can be anyone who wants to track and log notes, and it can be used as a todo list as well.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN the user opens the note-taker

THEN the user is presented with the home page and a link to the notes page

WHEN the user clicks on the notes page

THEN the user is presented with a page where the user can input a title and text

WHEN the user types in content to the title and text areas

THEN the user can see a save button appear on the top right of the page

WHEN the user clicks on the save button

THEN the note appears as a saved item on the left column

WHEN the user clicks on one of the saved items on the left column

THEN the user is presented with that saved item on the right section

WHEN the user clicks on the plus button on the top right of the page

THEN the user is presented with a blank page to write a new note

## Mock-Up
